# Wemo-for-Alexa
This sketch uses the IR codes to transmit the commands for    
 1. Samsung TV    
 2. Marantz Amplifier    
 3. Miele VaccumCleaner       
 More to come...
 
Some IR codes are RC5 and some are RAW.    
Wifi part (Witty) ESP8266 will receive commands from Alexa and parse them to the IR remote part.
